# EC282 SPRING 2023

## Syllabus 

## Course description 

Students studying business will learn about modern econometric analysis in this course. It offers resources for applying descriptive and regression analysis to deduce useful information from data. By the end of the semester, I hope that you will be comfortable using the **R** and **RStudio** interfaces, manipulating simple data, getting and analyzing sample statistics, and performing insightful regression analysis.

Importantly, you should understand the distinction between correlation and causation, as well as when the former suggests the latter. Randomization for causality will be a major issue of debate. We will learn how to construct an experimental research, validate the design, and establish the prerequisites for a causal link. This course also intends to highlight the limits of empirical studies, with a particular emphasis on the randomization approach to causal inference.


### Knowledge and Skills

* Compute and interpret the descriptive statistics of a sample.
* Understand the statistical uncertainty, construct and interpret the confidence intervals.
* Conduct hypothesis testing, interpret the test statistic and the results of a statistical test. 
* Construct a multivariate regression model, empirically estimate the model and interpret the results.
* In depth understanding of the randomized controlled trials and the  causal inference. 
* Understanding of the limitation of causal study designs. 

### Perspectives

* Learn how to conduct a regression analysis, understands its limitation in inferring a causal relationship, generalizing its results, and power in prediction an outcome that is unknown to the researcher.
* Understand the causal research design and its basic implementations. 
* Understand the regression diagnostics to choose the most appropriate definition of predictors, outcome, and functional form.

### Software and Collaborative Work

- **R** and **RStudio**:  I assume that you have a basic familiarity with or expect your effort to gain familiarity throughout the semester. The instructions installation, some basic rules and best practices on coding are on this web page. Keep in mind that this course is **not** designed to teach you R and more than anything, the best way to learn programming is to actually work on assigned problems. 
When learning R, arguably the most important skill that you need to acquire is to be able to **Google** your problem. There is probably not a single R question that you have yet has not been answered on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). 
  

- **Github**: I will post code and links on the [GitHub](https://github.com/) page of the course.

## Grading 

You **MUST** attend all the midterms and the final as there will be no make-up exams in this course. 
The midterms are **NOT** cumulative. If you miss or are likely to miss a midterm due to an emergency, please contact me as soon as possible.  You will need to provide supporting documentation/verification of your absence. I will re-weight your final exam accordingly if you have a valid excuse. Please note that family vacations or missing the school shuttle are not valid excuses. 

The final exam **is** cumulative. If you miss the final exam due to an emergency, you will receive an incomplete for this course. Do not take this class if you know that you will not be able to attend the final exam. 

You have **10 homework assignments**. The submission method is automated, and no submissions will be accepted after the deadline (even 5 minutes). There will be no exceptions if you fail to complete the assignment. You will obtain full credit if you correctly answer at least 70% of the questions. You have three attempts to answer each question and I will take the maximum for these attempts. You are encouraged to collaborate on homework tasks or to seek assistance from campus resources. 
    

### Academic Integrity 

Learning is a privilege that demands responsibility. At Bentley, students and faculty are members of an academic community that supports integrity both inside and outside the classroom. The expectation at Bentley is that students will take advantage of the opportunity for intellectual development and, in doing so, will conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the standards of academic integrity. When these standards are violated or compromised, individuals and the entire Bentley community suffer. Students who engage in acts of academic dishonesty not only face university censure but also may harm their future educational and employment opportunities. In other words, don’t bring unauthorized materials into exams, don’t plagiarize someone else’s work, and make sure that your collaborations are conducted in accordance with university and course policy.  

All students have access to Bentley’s academic integrity policy on Blackboard (via the Academic Integrity course page) and the Undergraduate Student Handbook/Graduate Catalog. The best way to avoid a problem is to consult with your instructor before taking any action that might constitute a violation. 


### Diversity Inclusion and Support 

**Statement of Diversity and Inclusion**

My goal in this class is to create a teaching environment that is inclusive for all of the members of our community independent of their race, gender, age, disability status, and political or religious views. Our differences strengthen our ability for perspective taking, being critical about our default believes,and enhance learning. 

I will try to reach this goal within my best capacity by respect and professionalism in our class-related engagements and I anticipate students to do the same. These standards of appropriate conduct are well summarized by [Bentley's Core Values](https://www.bentley.edu/about/mission-and-values) in our institution's mission statement. 


If you feel that I or anyone in this class has acted outside these values, please come to me so that we may discuss your experience. If you do not feel comfortable coming to me with your concerns, I encourage you to speak with someone in the Office of Academic Advising: 781.891.2803, academic_services@bentley.edu, Jennison 336.      

My class roster has your preferred name, but I will happily address you by an alternate name and/or pronoun. Just let me know your preference early in the semester. 

**Bias Incident Response**

The Bias Incident Response Team (BIRT) provides students affected by bias or bias-related incidents with access to appropriate resources. Where appropriate, BIRT assists the University in its response to situations that may impact the overall campus climate related to diversity and inclusion. Working closely with appropriate students, faculty, committees, organizations, and staff, BIRT plays an educational role in fostering an inclusive campus community and supporting targeted individuals when bias or bias-related incidents occur. More information about BIRT and how to file a bias incident report can be found at: https://www.bentley.edu/offices/student-affairs/birt

**Disability Services** 

Bentley University abides by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 which stipulate no student shall be denied the benefits of an education solely by reason of a disability. If you have a hidden or visible disability which may require classroom accommodations, please call (if you are a residential student or on online student) Disability Services within the first 4 weeks of the semester to schedule an appointment. Disability Services is located in the Office of Academic Services (JEN 336, 781.891.2004). Disability Services is responsible for managing accommodations and services for all students with disabilities. 

The Undergraduate Academic Services (UAS) Peer Tutoring program offers online one-on-one and small group tutoring services for students who have worked with their instructors and made use of the Learning Centers, but still require additional academic support. The program goal is to help those students in true need who are willing to take responsibility for their own learning. Please reach out to me if you need more information.
