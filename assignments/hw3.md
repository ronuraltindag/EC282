# Homework Assignment 3
## Deadline: November 6, 2022  11PM 

**Source:** Stock and Watson, 4th Edition, Exercise 5.3   

**Data description:** You can find the [data description  here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s0q564v6lplbexu/Birthweight_Smoking_Description.pdf?dl=1
). 


## Questions 

**a.** Run a regression of ```birthweight``` on ```age```. Interpret the coefficient on age. Is the coefficients statistically significant?

**b.** Estimate the mean and the standard error of birth weight for (i) mother who smoked during the pregnancy and (ii) mother who did not smoke during the pregnancy. 

**c.** Estimate the difference between (i) and (ii). Construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in the average ```birthweight``` for smoking and nonsmoking mothers. 

**d.** Run a regression of ```birthweight``` on on the binary variable ```smoker``` explain how the estimated intercept, slope related to your previous answers. How about the standard error of the estimated slope? 


## Header for the R script

Start a new R script, copy/paste the header below and save it to ```Dropbox\EC282\Assignment3``` or a similar path that you created for this homework assignment. Run the R script and make sure that you have the data ```df1``` in your environment. Conduct the analysis below the header. 

```

# list the packages we need and loads them, installs them automatically if we don't have them
