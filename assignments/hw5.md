# Homework Assignment 5
## Deadline: December 4, 2022  11PM 

**Source:** Stock and Watson, 4th Edition, Exercise 7.1   

**Data description:** You can find the [data description  here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s0q564v6lplbexu/Birthweight_Smoking_Description.pdf?dl=1
). 



## Questions 

**a.** Regress (i) ```birthweight``` on ```smoker```, ```alcohol```,```nprevist```, and ```unmarried```. Interpret the coefficient on ```unmarried```. 

**b.** Construct a 95% confidence interval on for the coefficient. Is it statistically significant? Is the magnitude of the coefficient large? 

**c.** Looking at this regression, a family advocacy group claims that higher rates of marriage will lead to healthier babies thus one obviuous public policy is to encourage marriage. Do you agree? 

**d.** Consider the data set that you have and briefly discuss what variables can be added to the regression to help to solve question (c). 

**e.** Run the regression with these additional controls. How did the coefficient on marriage has changed with these additional controls. 


## Header for the R script

Start a new R script, copy/paste the header below and save it to ```Dropbox\EC282\Assignment5``` or a similar path that you created for this homework assignment. Run the R script and make sure that you have the data ```df1``` in your environment. Conduct the analysis below the header. 

```

# list the packages we need and loads them, installs them automatically if we don't have them
# add any package that you need to the list

setwd(getwd()) #change getwd() here is you need to set a different working directory


#this clears the workspace
